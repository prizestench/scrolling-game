# scrolling game

This repository contains the implementation of the Super Scrolling Game, a 2D side-scrolling game. The project focuses on object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, and collections, while also encouraging creativity in game mechanics and design.

## Game Overview

The Super Scrolling Game challenges players to navigate a scrolling environment, collect rewards, and avoid obstacles. Players must strategically control their avatar to maximize their score and sustain their health points (HP).

### Game Rules
- **Objective**: Reach a score of 300 to win or survive without losing all HP.
- **Gameplay**:
  - Use arrow keys to move your avatar (blue square with "P").
  - Collect "Get" items (green squares with "G") for points (+20).
  - Collect "Rare Get" items (flashing squares with "G") for points (+20) and HP (+1).
  - Avoid "Avoid" items (red squares with "A") to prevent HP loss (-1).
- **Game End**:
  - Win by reaching 300 points.
  - Lose if HP is reduced to 0.

### Additional Controls
- `Esc`: Exit the game.
- `P`: Pause the game.
- `+` / `-`: Adjust game speed.
- `D`: Toggle debug mode for developer insights.
